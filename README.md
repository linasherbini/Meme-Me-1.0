# Meme-Me-1.0
MemeMe 1.0 is the second project of Udacity's iOS Development Nanodegree.
It's an iOS application that allows the user to create their memes by uploading picture from their photo library or their camera then add their own top and bottom texts to the picture.
It also allows them to share their meme with people through the app and saving it to their photo library.
